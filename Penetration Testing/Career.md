# Where do penetration testers work?

## Penetration testers typically work in one of three environments.

### In-house

As an in-house penetration tester, you work directly for a company or organization. 
This typically allows you to get to know the company’s security protocols well. 
You may also have more input into new security features and fixes.

### Security firm

Some organizations hire an outside security firm to conduct penetration testing. 
Working for a security firm offers greater variety in the types of tests you’ll get to design and perform. 

### Freelance: 

Some penetration testers choose to work as freelancers. 
Choosing this path can give you greater flexibility in your schedule, but you may need to spend more time looking for clients early in your career.
