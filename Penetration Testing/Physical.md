## Why Should You Perform A Physical Penetration Test?

Physical barriers are often an afterthought for most businesses, however, if a malicious actor is able to gain physical access to your server room then they could own your network. Imagine the impact that might have on your business, on your customers, as well as business partnerships.

 

The primary benefit of a physical penetration test is to expose weaknesses and vulnerabilities in physical controls (locks, barriers, cameras, or sensors) so that flaws can be quickly addressed. Through identifying these weaknesses proper mitigations can be put in place to strengthen the physical security posture.
