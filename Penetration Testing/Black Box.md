During a black box penetration test (also known as external penetration testing) the pen tester is given little to no information regarding the IT infrastructure of a business.

 
The main benefit of this method of testing is to simulate a real-world cyber attack, whereby the pen tester assumes the role of an uninformed attacker.

This method of testing is also referred to as the “trial and error” approach, however, there is a high degree of technical skill involved in this process.

## External Penetration Test

External penetration testing consists of testing vulnerabilities to review the chances of being attacked by any remote attacker. By exploiting the found vulnerabilities it identifies the information being exposed to outsiders.

The main objective of this test is to simulate an attack on the internal network by mimicking the actions of an actual threat actor.

 

This type of penetration testing attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities of a system to steal or compromise the organization’s information. As a result, the test will show whether the implemented security measures are enough to secure an organization and to assess its capability to defend against any external attack.

 

On average, an external penetration test will take 2-3 weeks to complete. However, this depends on the complexity of the system, the size of the network, and the goals of the test itself.

## Examples of external penetration tests include:
 
- Configuration & Deployment Management Testing
- Identity Management Testing
- Authentication Testing
- Authorization Testing
- Session Management Testing, Input Validation Testing
- Testing for weak Cryptography
- Business Logic Testing
- Client Side Testing
- Testing for Error Handling.

## Testing methodologies include:
 
- Footprinting
- Checking for public information and other information leakages.
- System Scanning/Port Scanning/Service Scanning for vulnerabilities
- Manual testing identified vulnerabilities.
- IDS/IPS Testing
- Password Strength Testing

## Popular tools used in external penetration tests are:

- Nessus
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite Pro
- Dirbuster/Dirb/GoBuster
- Nikto
- Sqlmap
- Recon-ng
- Nmap
- Hydra
- GHDB
- theHarvester

### Internal Penetration Test

 An internal penetration test uses a different way of dealing with the attacks and comes into the picture after completion of an external penetration test. In this test, the main focus is to identify what could be accomplished by an attacker who has internal access to your network.

 

Prior to engaging with a vendor consider having the following checklist of items available:

 

- Your goals for performing a pen test.
- The number of internal workstations on the network.
- The number of servers.
- The total number of internal and external IPs.

This can be a threat actor who penetrated the organization’s external defense systems or it can be an employee, contractor, or other staff with internal access.

### Internal penetration tests include using:

- Computer Systems
- Access Points
- WiFi Networks
- Firewalls
- IDS/IPS
- Local Servers
- Employees
 
 
Once those vulnerabilities are identified, testers exploit them to discover the impact of an attack and show the weakness/entry points to the organization.

 

Internal penetration testing is not just limited to exploiting internal network vulnerabilities, but it also includes privilege escalation, malware spreading, man in the middle attacks (MITM), credential stealing, monitoring, information leakage or any other malicious activity.

 

You might be wondering why you would conduct an internal penetration test, to begin with, given your systems are supposedly secure from any external threats.

 

However, internal tests provide the results to an organization that should an attacker manage to gain access equivalent to an insider, or if any malicious internal user tries to break the security, what impactful it could have in terms of disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of organization’s confidential information.


### Testing methodologies include:
 
- Internal Network Scanning
- Port Scanning and System Fingerprinting
- Finding vulnerabilities
- Exploiting
- Manual Vulnerability Testing and Verification
- Firewall and ACL Testing
- Administrator Privileges Escalation Testing
- Password Strength Testing
- Network Equipment Security Controls Testing
- Database Security Controls Testing
- Internal Network Scan for Known Trojans
- Third-Party/Vendor Security Configuration Testing
 

### Popular tools used in internal penetration testing:

- Nikto
- Sqlmap
- Nessus
- Responder
