# Client Side Penetration Testing

Client side penetration testing is used to discover vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in client side applications.

 

These could be a program or applications such as Putty, email clients, web browsers (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), Macromedia Flash, and others. Programs like Adobe Photoshop and the Microsoft Office Suite are also subject to testing.
