## The 7 Stages of PTES
The PTES methodology is a structured approach to penetration testing balancing guided phases with organizational vulnerabilities.  
The standard is organized in sections that define what should be included in a quality penetration test.

### PTES defines penetration testing in seven phases:
#### 1. Pre-Engagement Interactions
#### 2. Intelligence Gathering
#### 3. Threat Modeling
#### 4. Vulnerability Analysis
#### 5. Exploitation
#### 6. Post-Exploitation
#### 7. Reporting
